## Task 1
### Sub-Task: A
### Status: In Progress
### Approved: Yes
Extract job description variables for base resume optimization (located in the directory 'job_search/auto_application/resumes/base_resume'); the variables (as a starting point - this can be expanded where more labeling can be created) are located under 'job_search/auto_application/jd_variables_extraction_glossary.md'. This functionality should extract the variables that are to be used to optimize the resume in a folder where each job's outputs will be stored in a separate .md file with a starting ID of 1 (increment for each new file) alongside the company name and job title in the file name - ending with the date of extraction in the format YYYMMDD.


### Sub-Task: B
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Update the base resume with the extracted variables for the job defined in Sub-Task A; create a file for the resume with the same file name but extended with _ro (resume optimized). Please utilize the best and most reliable approach for this task as it will be the resume that is utilized for the job application.

### Sub-Task: C
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Add a CLI helper to batch-run JD variable extraction against a job_details CSV (pick rows by index or filter) and drop markdown outputs into the variables_extracted folder.

### Sub-Task: D
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Add lightweight tests/fixtures for the extractor (LLM mocked) to keep schemas stable and prevent regressions.

## Task 2
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Make the search pipeline non-interactive by allowing CLI flags/env for salary range, job type, and geography (fall back to prompts).

---
## Task 3
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Add resilience to LinkedIn auth: detect missing/expired cookies early and prompt/guide manual refresh; optionally support username/password + MFA token for automation.

---
## Task 4
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Harden apply-link extraction: cap retries, add structured outputs for failure reasons, and unit-test selectors against saved HTML in debug_snapshots.

---
## Task 5
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Streamline aggregation: consider writing master + salary-filtered JSON/CSV in one place and exposing a latest-artifacts pointer for downstream steps.

---
## Task 6
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Auto-apply safety: add a dry-run flag that stops before form submission but captures field mappings; expand form fillers for Lever/Workday edge cases.

---
## Task 7
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Observability: centralize logs (per run folders) and add a lightweight status dashboard summarizing counts, failures, and where to resume.

---
## Task 8
### Status: Not Started
### Approved: Yes
Create a validation screenshot capture function to take screenshots of the application process as it moves through the process of each job and store it in a folder for checking the status of each step.
