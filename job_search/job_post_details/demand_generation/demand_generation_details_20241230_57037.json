This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don’t have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows. At Retool, we’re on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We’re building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag and drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that’s a mission worth striving for. Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know! WHY WE’RE LOOKING FOR YOU As the Head of Demand Gen you will own the pipeline number that drives Retool’s growth. Retool has both a robust PLG as well as Sales led motion and we sell deals from 10k to $1M. We’re looking for a seasoned executive who has seen a variety of marketing models and strategies and can creatively problem solve for what Retool needs in this stage of growth, for our product and market, and not simply “run the playbook” from your last company. We have ambitious plans for the company and the Head of Demand Gen is at the center of making this happen. You will craft the marketing and demand gen strategy in collaboration with other sales and marketing leaders and drive the execution that predictably gets us to our pipeline goals.

Whether it’s holding a PhD level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful. Diversity & Inclusion Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
